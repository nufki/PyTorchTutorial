# Transforms
###############################################################################

# Data does not always come in its final processed form that is required for training machine learning algorithms.
# We use transforms to perform some manipulation of the data and make it suitable for training.

# All TorchVision datasets have two parameters -transform to modify the features and target_transform to modify the labels
# The torchvision.transforms module offers several commonly-used transforms out of the box.

# The FashionMNIST features are in PIL Image format, and the labels are integers. For training, we need the features as normalized tensors,
# and the labels as one-hot encoded tensors. To make these transformations, we use ToTensor and Lambda.

import torch
from torchvision import datasets
from torchvision.transforms import ToTensor, Lambda

ds = datasets.FashionMNIST(
    root="data",
    train=True,
    download=True,
    transform=ToTensor(),
    # Lambda transforms apply any user-defined lambda function. Here, we define a function to turn the integer into a one-hot
    # encoded tensor. It first creates a zero tensor of size 10 (the number of labels in our dataset) and calls scatter_
    # which assigns a value=1 on the index as given by the label y
    target_transform=Lambda(lambda y: torch.zeros(10, dtype=torch.float).scatter_(0, torch.tensor(y), value=1))
)
